    <h2>History Of Bulleen</h2>
    <h3>Pre European settlement</h3>
<p>The Bulleen billabongs were an important territory for the Manna Gum people
  for approximately 5,000 years.[4] Generations had lived on the river flats
  when wild fish and ducks were abundant. Bolin was the largest lake/billabong
  in the area and was a significant ritual meeting place for the aborigines, where
  numerous corroborees were held either by the billabong or on the hills. But by 1841,
  manager and protector of the aborigines William Thomas received different orders.

<h3>Post-European settlement</h3>

<p>In 1841 Frederic Unwin, a Sydney solicitor, purchased 5,120 acres, or eight square
  miles of land, including all of the present suburb of Bulleen.[citation needed] The
  land was purchased from the Crown for one pound an acre under the terms of the short-lived
  Special Survey regulations. The area was sometimes known as Unwin's Special Survey. <br>
The first Bulleen Post Office opened on 1 April 1952, was renamed Bulleen West in 1960
and closed in 1976. Bulleen South office opened in 1959, was renamed Bulleen in 1960 and
again named Bulleen South in 1969 when the current Bulleen office opened. </p>
