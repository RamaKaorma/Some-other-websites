    <h2>History Of Donvale</h2>
    <h3>Settlement</h3>
    <p>Settlement of the area dates from the mid 1800s. A postal district since 1926, Donvale
    was until 1994 in the City of Doncaster and Templestowe. Until the middle of the 20th
    century the district was predominantly a fruit-growing area. Suburbanisation followed
    increased motor car ownership and the availability of land after orchard subdivision from
    the 1950s. Significant development occurred during the post-war years, with subdivision
    commencing in the areas south of Doncaster Road in the 1950s. The larger-lot, lower density
    areas of the suburb, such as those east of Springvale Road, date from the 1970s and 1980s.
    The population has increased slightly since the early 1990s, a result of new dwellings being added to the area. </p>
