    <h2>History Of Box Hill</h2>
    <h3>Settlement</h3>
<p>Box Hill was first settled by the squatter Arundel Wrighte, formerly of
Van Diemen's Land, who in 1838 took up a pastoral lease on the land he
had previously explored in the Bushy Creek area. The first permanent
settlers, Thomas Toogood and his wife Edith, purchased 5,000 acres
(20 km²) in 1841 and Wrighte built a house on his property, "Marionvale",
in 1844. The Pioneers' Memorial, which can be found in front of the town hall,
is made from a chimney stone, taken from Wrighte's original house. It was not until
after 1850, however, that Crown lands were subdivided and sold. Traffic along a main
road running through the district encouraged the building of a hotel at Box Hill in 1853.
Its owner named it the White Horse hotel and the name was bestowed on the road.
Box Hill Post Office opened on 1 February 1861, being the first official
use of the name. The postmaster proposed the name, derived from Box Hill,
Surrey, England, near his birthplace.  <br>
In 1871 Box Hill township's population was 154 and the district relied on
orchards, vineyards and mixed farming. The extension of the railway line from
Camberwell to Lilydale in 1882 included a station at Box Hill, but there were
also stations at Canterbury and Surrey Hills, to the west. They attracted
subdivisions and development ahead of Box Hill. Growth came, though, with a
school opening in Box Hill in 1887 and the town became the seat of the
Nunawading Shire Council, which met at the Box Hill Courthouse.  <br>
In 1895 a market opened near the railway station, which improved Box Hill's
commercial importance. Box Hill was also the starting point for a tramline to Doncaster,
which ran from 1889 to 1896. This was the first electric tram line in the southern hemisphere.
The 1890s also saw the opening of a gas works, several brickworks and a private girls' high school.</p> <br>
<h3>Inter War</h3>
<p>Unlike suburbs closer to Melbourne, Box Hill lacked the web of tramlines,
which promoted residential development beyond the reach of the railway line.
In 1916-17 tramlines reached the western edge of what in a short time would
be the Box Hill Municipality, at Burwood, Mont Albert, and Wattle Park. The
years after the First World War saw Box Hill's turn for residential growth.
A girls' technical school was built in 1924 and a boys' high school in 1930.
During the Second World War a boys' technical school was opened.  <br>
In 1933, in its eightieth year, the Whitehorse Hotel was demolished.
It had been closed since 1921, when Box Hill prohibited the sale of alcohol
in the town area. </p><br>
<h3>Box Hill Town Hall</h3>
<p>The new Town Hall on Whitehorse Road opened in April 1935. One of the arguments
for its construction was that " the boon it would prove to the local brickworks,
which had just resumed production after a period of suspension".  <br>
The Box Hill Presbyterian (now Uniting) Church building was originally the West
Melbourne Presbyterian Church built 1867 on the corner of Lonsdale and William
Streets; a final service was held on 3 February 1935, following which the building
was dismantled and re-erected on its present site, being opened in late 1935.
After the end of the Second World War Box Hill was suburbanised, but Box Hill South
and Box Hill North remained comparatively undeveloped. </p><br>
<h3>Post war</h3>
<p>Post war housing expansion included a Housing Commission estate in Box Hill South.
A district hospital opened in 1956. The shopping area enjoyed growth and prosperity
which, ironically, by the end of the 1950s was putting a strain on it; there was not
enough space for parking. The development of Myer Eastland and Doncaster Shoppingtown
in the late 1960s took trade away, and the shopping centre regained custom by undergrounding
the railway line and station and building Box Hill Central on land, which included the old market.  <br>
In 1954 the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works designated Box Hill as one of five district
centres for metropolitan Melbourne. The plan has succeeded in Box Hill. In addition to
the shopping centre, the Box Hill TAFE and several office buildings have strengthened its
centrality in the region. Apart from commercial functions there are large reserves, with
ovals in three directions, about a kilometre from Box Hill Central. Box Hill South lies
between Canterbury Road and Burwood East, about two kilometres square. Its proximity to
trams was better than Box Hill North's and its residential growth was substantially pre
and early post war. The Box Hill Golf Club is nearby and a linear park continues along
Gardiners Creek. There are church educational institutions; Kingswood College (Anglican
and then Uniting) and the Christian Brothers' Teachers' College and St. Leo's College
(1952 and 1957).  <br>
In 1971, a sister city relationship was forged with Matsudo, Chiba Prefecture, Japan.
"Box Hill" is the name of a department store in Matsudo (ja:ボックスヒル).  <br>
Box Hill City was amalgamated with Nunawading City on 15 December 1994, to form Whitehorse
City, renewing the boundaries that began with the Nunawading Parish and subsequent Shire.</p>
