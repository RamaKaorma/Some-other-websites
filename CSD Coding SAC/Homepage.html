  <h3>Templestowe</h3>
  <p>How it was named <br>
The village of Templestowe was surveyed in 1852. Two theories have been
offered to explain the derivation of its name. One suggests it derived
from Sir Walter Scott's novel Ivanhoe. The second is that it originated
from a small English settlement called Temple's Stowe. <br>
